Script created by Salvador Camacho

This script was created with best practices, so it is more resilient, such as:
* Mainly AI, but property-based steps when needed
* Data Driving, parametrization of credentials, URL, search term and Browser
* Some main validations

This script logs in to Documentum D2 Classic, does a searhc and then logs out
